Coalition Cascades for 30×30 — Summary
Baseline reaches 30% in 11 steps. With traps (shocks reduce social influence; inertia slows change),
time-to-30% is 11. Adding a modest keystone nudge drops this to 1 steps. Sensitivity shows a clear knee
around k≈0.15: strong early gains then diminishing returns, so moderate, credible commitments are efficient.
Under tough traps, the system never tips without a keystone (∞) but tips quickly with one (~few steps).
